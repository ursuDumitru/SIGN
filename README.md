# SignLanguageRecognition

## TODO

- [] have 5 signs in total
- [] build an app ?
- [] normalize coordonates(data-set) [link1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a99p_fAr6e4)
- [] hand gesture controlled presentation [link2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKmAZss-T5Y)
- [] create a csv files for sign labels that I train and use
- [] restructure the project (use snake_case)
- [] make the model be built on static images rather that video sequences(create a mode where you have the camera+mediapipe opened and you can press a button to take a picture)
(maybe have like 2 examples of use for my license, one to create sentences, another to control a presentation)
