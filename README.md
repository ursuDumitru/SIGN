# SignLanguageRecognition

## TODO

- [] make a way for the model to tell if there is no active sign detected
- [+] have 5 signs in total
- [] build an app ?
- [+] normalize coordinates(data-set) [link1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a99p_fAr6e4)
- [] hand gesture controlled presentation [link2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKmAZss-T5Y)
- [+] create a csv files for sign labels that I train and use
- [] restructure the project (use snake_case)
- [] make the model be built on static images rather than video sequences(create a mode where you have the camera+mediapipe opened and you can press a button to take a picture)
- [] create tests for the project
- [] think if you will use x,y,z or just x,y (also, for normalization which will be the max value ?)
(maybe have like 2 examples of use for my license, one to create sentences, another to control a presentation)
